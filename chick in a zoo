Initially, the zoo have a single chick. A chick gives birth to 2 chicks every day and the life expectancy of a chick is 6 days. Zoo officials want to buy food for
chicks so they want to know the number of chicks on an Nth day. Help the officials with this task.
 

Example 1:

Input: N = 2 
Output: 3
Explanation: First day there is only 1 chick.
On second day total number of chicks = 3. 
Example 2:

Input: N = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: First day there is only 1 chick.
On second day total number of chicks = 3.
On third day total number of chicks = 9

solution:
we store only new chicks and after 6 days we subtract old chicks


long long int NoOfChicks(int n){
	    // Code here
	    vector<long long int>ans(n,0);
	    ans[0]=1;
	    long long int count=1;
	    for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
	    {
	        if(i>5){
	            count=count-ans[i-6];
	        }
	        ans[i]=2*count;
	        count+=ans[i];
	    }
	    return count;
	}
